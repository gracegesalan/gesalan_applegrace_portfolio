# Apple Grace Gesalan Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio website! This will serve as a window into my creative world, offering insights into my background,  creative journey, and showcasing my best work. The website consists of three pages:

Homepage
The homepage provides a warm introduction to my portfolio. It features a brief yet informative overview of my background, artistic passions, and creative endeavors. This section acts as a gateway to explore my work further.

Portfolio Page
My portfolio page is where the magic happens. Clicking on the projects showcased on the homepage gallery will seamlessly transport you to the dedicated "Portfolio Pages" for each project. Here, you'll find in-depth details, comprehensive descriptions, high-resolution images, and a short description of each project. It's a place where you can delve into my work.

Contact Page
Staying connected with my audience is essential to me, and that's why I've included a Contact page. Whether you have questions, feedback, or collaboration ideas, I'm always eager to engage in meaningful conversations.

Additionally, I maintain a Print Shop where you can explore and purchase some of my artwork, bringing a piece of my creative world into your own space.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio website, and I hope you enjoy your exploration.
